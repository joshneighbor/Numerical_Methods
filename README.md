 Numerical Methods for solving sepcific linear systems
 Modified the Thomas algorithm (named after Llewellyn Thomas), which is a simplified form of Gaussian elimination
 that can be used to solve tridiagonal systems of equations.
 My modification allows for solving of Block Diagonal matrices

 Also includes:
 1) An Algorithm to pull out the LU decomposition from my modified Block Thomas algorithm
 2) test code of working example
 3) Another solver with slight modifications from the Newton-Raphson Method

 The purpose is to use these functions for solving numerous types of systems of equations.
